# dummychat.py -- test chat terminal for TPRG2131 F2019 Project 2
# Reply to CONNECTREQ and chat messages from a terminal. This is
# used to test the terminal that initiates the conversation in the
# Project 2 communication system.
#
# Run this from PowerShell (Windows) or bash (Linux)
#
# The response is "hard coded" to reply to the messages sent by
# the terminal being tested. See the message definitions in the
# project documentation.

# Client-server examples based on tutorial by Nathan Jennings
